# A new efficient grain growth model using a random Gaussian-sampled mode filter

:fire: ***Join us for the development of Mode Filter! This project is under active development!***

## Usage
1. main.py shows 2D and 3D MF simulations examples
2. the operations for mode filter are in functions.py


## 2D Simulation Results
